* Rate Limiting and Throttling:

  Monitor API Usage: Keep an eye on how frequently your app is making requests to the Jooble API to avoid hitting rate limits.

  Implement Throttling: If necessary, implement throttling mechanisms to control the rate of outgoing requests, especially in scenarios where users might trigger multiple searches in quick succession.

* User Feedback and Loading States:

  Loading Indicators: Provide visual feedback (like progress bars or loading spinners) while network requests are in progress to enhance user experience.

  Empty States: Handle scenarios where searches return no results by informing the user appropriately.
